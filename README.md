# TITTLE: WEEK 1 CODE LAB CHALLENGES

# DESCRIPTION: THIS REPOSITORY CONTAINS THE SOLUTIONS FOR THE CODE LAB CHALLENGES

# CHALLENGE 1:

 Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond the correct grade, as shown below: 

        A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

# Student Grading System
This web application provides a simple way to calculate and display student grades based on user input. The grading is determined using a standard grading scale.

# Features

Dynamic Grading: Grades are calculated and displayed immediately as the user inputs a grade.
Standard Grading Scale: Grades are determined based on the following ranges:

A: Above 79
B: 60 to 79
C: 50 to 60
D: 41 to 49
E: 40 or below

# Files

1. index.html: Contains the HTML structure for the application.
2. styles.css: Contains the CSS styles for the application.
3. app.js: Contains the JavaScript code for the grading logic.

# Requirements

A modern web browser to run the application.

# CHALLENGE 2

  Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g: 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok." Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

   > For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.
